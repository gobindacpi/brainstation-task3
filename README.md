We can host our micro service in any cloud service provider , like AWS, GCP or any public openstack platform to reduce downtime and hardware fault tolerrence.  And application side we can use any automation tools like ansible .

Any application deployment we can create multiple replica to reduce  pod die issue, if on pod got died then other pod will provide service continuesly. 

For Monitoing we can use ELK , Promithues etc.
